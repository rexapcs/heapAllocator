README: p4 p4Heap Dynamic Memory Allocator


### Provided Files
README   link to project page and info about other files
Makefile used by make to build a shared object file needed for testing
p4Heap.h header file with the signatures for public "shared" functions
p4Heap.c source code with functions that must be completed

### To build p4Heap object file:
EDIT     vim p4Heap.c (complete functions where indicated by TODO tags)
COMPILE  make         (this will build p4Heap.o and libheap.so)

### To test your heap functions:
cd tests              (change to the tests sub-directory)
make                  (compiles all tests and runs test_align1)
make partA            (runs the tests that only require balloc works)
make partB            (runs the tests that require balloc and bfree)
make partC            (runs the tests that require balloc, bfree, coalesce)
